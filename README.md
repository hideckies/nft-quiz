This is a game that confirms your ability to determine the value of the NFT.  
Which is expensive? Make sure the NFT is valuable to you.

### Rules

1. Compare the prices at which the asset last sold.
2. The value of asset that have never been sold is regarded as "0 ETH".
3. Currently, due to the OpenSea API, it only supports Ethereum chain. (Polygon etc. are not supported)
